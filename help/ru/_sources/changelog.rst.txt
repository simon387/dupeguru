Changelog
=========

**About the word "crash":** When reading this changelog, you might be alarmed at the number of fixes
for "crashes". Be aware that when the word "crash" is used here, it refers to "soft crashes" which
don't cause the application to quit. You simply get an error window that asks you if you want to
send the crash report to Hardcoded Software. Crashes that cause the application to quit are called
"hard crashes" in this changelog.
