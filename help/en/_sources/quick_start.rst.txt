Quick Start
===========

To get you quickly started with dupeGuru, let's just make a standard scan using default preferences.

* Launch dupeGuru.
* Add folders to scan with either drag & drop or the "+" button.
* Click on **Scan**.
* Wait until the scan process is over.
* Look at every duplicate (The files that are indented) and verify that it is indeed a duplicate to the group's reference (The file above the duplicate that is not indented and have a disabled mark box).
* If a file is a false duplicate, select it and click on **Actions-->Remove Selected from Results**.
* Once you are sure that there is no false duplicate in your results, click on **Edit-->Mark All**, and then **Actions-->Send Marked to Recycle bin**.

That is only a basic scan. There are a lot of tweaking you can do to get different results and several methods of examining and modifying your results. To know about them, just read the rest of this help file.
